# site-util

[Static] websites utility functions.

I have a markdown based static site generator and these are some helper
functions to aid with pre-processing work: add date, insert images, etc.

Requires [Hotpot](https://github.com/rktjmp/hotpot.nvim) as the plugin is
written in Fennel, and also requires utility functions [from my own config](https://github.com/alexaandru/nvim-config),
so all in all, you probably don't need this repo, unless you are me :-)
